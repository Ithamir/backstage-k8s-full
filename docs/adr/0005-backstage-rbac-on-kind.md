# ADR-0005: Backstage RBAC on kind

## Status

Accepted

Supersedes ADR-0004's decision that GitHub OAuth credentials stay in `backstage/app-config.local.yaml`.

Closes ADR-0004's deferred KinD / Helm-chart deployment item for the RBAC configuration.

## Context

ADR-0004 recorded the first RBAC slice as a local `yarn dev` demonstration. That slice established the RBAC plugin choice, committed CSV policy, the `viewer` and `platform-admin` roles, and a GitHub admin identity. It also kept OAuth credentials in `backstage/app-config.local.yaml` and deferred chart deployment.

The supported runtime for the demo is now the kind cluster. Maintaining GitHub OAuth sign-in for both `yarn start` and kind would require separate callback URLs and separate secret delivery paths for no current workflow benefit.

## Decision

### OAuth Credentials Use a Kubernetes Secret

GitHub OAuth credentials are delivered to the pod through a Kubernetes Secret named `backstage-github-oauth` by default. The chart exposes:

```yaml
oauth:
  github:
    create: false
    existingSecret: backstage-github-oauth
    clientId: ""
    clientSecret: ""
```

When `oauth.github.create` is `true`, the chart renders a Secret with `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. When it is `false`, the Deployment references `oauth.github.existingSecret`.

This mirrors the existing GitHub PAT pattern under `github.auth.{create,existingSecret,token}` while keeping OAuth credentials out of committed config.

### RBAC Files Are Delivered by ConfigMap

The chart's runtime ConfigMap delivers `app-config.runtime.yaml`, `rbac-policies.csv`, and `users.yaml` to `/etc/backstage`.

The canonical files remain at their repo-root locations and are passed during install with:

```bash
helm upgrade --install backstage charts/backstage \
  --set-file rbac.policies=backstage/rbac-policies.csv \
  --set-file rbac.users=users.yaml
```

The Deployment's `checksum/config` annotation covers the full rendered ConfigMap, so edits to runtime config, policies, or users roll the pod on the next Helm upgrade.

### Kind Is the Supported GitHub OAuth Runtime

GitHub OAuth sign-in is supported on the kind deployment at `http://backstage.localtest.me:8080`.

`yarn start` remains useful for typecheck, tests, and guest UI iteration, but GitHub sign-in through `yarn start` is no longer part of the supported surface.

### Delete the Local Example

`backstage/app-config.local.example.yaml` is deleted because it documented the unsupported `yarn start` GitHub sign-in path. Git history preserves the old content if that path is intentionally revived later.

The existing `.gitignore` entry for `backstage/app-config.local.yaml` remains in force. A maintainer's existing local file may remain on disk, but it is inert for the kind deployment path.

## Consequences

- ADR-0004's RBAC plugin choice remains in force.
- ADR-0004's committed CSV-as-source-of-truth decision remains in force.
- ADR-0004's `viewer` and `platform-admin` role design remains in force.
- ADR-0004's OAuth-credentials-in-`backstage/app-config.local.yaml` decision is superseded.
- The deferred kind / Helm-chart deployment item from ADR-0004 is closed.
- Secret bootstrap is a one-time cluster setup step, not a file committed to git.
- RBAC policy and catalog identity edits no longer require rebuilding the Backstage image.

## Out of Scope

- Production deployment beyond kind.
- HTTPS OAuth callbacks.
- Multi-environment OAuth App management.
- External secret managers.
- GitHub organization-and-team ingestion.
- Custom roles beyond `viewer` and `platform-admin`.
- Conditional rules and finer-grained plugin permissions.
- Automated OAuth App provisioning.
